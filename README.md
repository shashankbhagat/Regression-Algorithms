# Regression-Algorithms
The code describes a sample data of integers. The data has one input feature and a labelled data.
Simple Linear regression performed using Linear Regression Algorithms and SVR Algorithm.
The performance metrics for both are displayed in the code.
The covariance and the covariance coefficient is also calculated between the features and labelled data.
Visualisation done using scatter plots and bar graphs.
